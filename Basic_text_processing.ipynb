The pre-processing steps required in the assignment are tokenization, removal of words of length 1, removal of stop words, converting all words to lowercase, removal of all tokens which appear only once and removal of top 50 tokens which appear the most in the documents. After preprocessing, we are required to extract bigrams and save the preprocessed job descriptions and vocab in txt files. "
